Approching Remote Sensing Image Classification with Ensembles of Support Vector Machines on the D-Wave Quantum Annealer


Support  Vector  Machine  (SVM)  is  a  supervised  MachineLearning  (ML)  method  that  is  widely  used  for  the  classifi-cation  of  land-cover  and  land-use  classes  in  Remote  Sens-ing  (RS)  images.   A  method  to  train  SVMs  on  a  D-Wave2000Q  Quantum  Annealer  (QA)  was  recently  proposed  forbinary classification problems on biology data.  First, ensem-bles of sub-optimal quantum SVMs are generated by trainingeach  classifier  on  a  disjoint  training  subset  that  can  be  fitinto the QA.   Then,  the computed suboptimal solutions areadopted for making predictions on unseen data.   This workapproaches the classification of RS multispectral images forthe first time with SVMs on a QA.  Furthermore, it releasesan  open  code  repository  to  let  those  uninitiated  in  Quan-tum Computing (QC) to familiarize themselves with the newtechnology.
