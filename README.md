Approching Remote Sensing Image Classification with Ensembles of Support Vector Machines on the D-Wave Quantum Annealer


Support  Vector  Machine  (SVM)  is  a  supervised  Machine Learning  (ML)  method  that  is  widely  used  for  the  classification  of  land-cover  and  land-use  
classes  in  Remote  Sensing  (RS)  images. A  method  to  train  SVMs  on  a  D-Wave2000Q  Quantum  Annealer  (QA)  was  recently  proposed  forbinary classification 
problems on biology data. First, ensembles of sub-optimal quantum SVMs are generated by training each  classifier  on  a  disjoint  training  subset  that  can  be  fit into  
the QA. Then, the computed suboptimal solutions are adopted for making predictions on unseen data.
