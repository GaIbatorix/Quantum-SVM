# Remote Sensing Image Classification with Ensembles of Support Vector Machines on the D-Wave Quantum Annealer

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised Machine Learning (ML) method that is widely used for the classification of land-cover and land-use classes in Remote Sensing (RS) images. A method to train SVMs on a D-Wave2000Q Quantum Annealer (QA) was recently proposed forbinary classification problems on biology data. First, ensembles of sub-optimal quantum SVMs are generated by training each classifier on a disjoint training subset that can be fit into the QA. Then, the computed suboptimal solutions are adopted for making predictions on unseen data.

👌Everyone can make a free account to run on the D-Wave2000Q computer: 

- Make a free account to run on the D-Wave through 👉 (https://www.dwavesys.com/take-leap

- Install Ocean Software with 'pip install dwave-ocean-sdk' 👉 https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/latest/overview/install.html

- Configuring the D-Wave System as a Solver with 'dwave config create' 👉 https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/latest/overview/dwavesys.html#dwavesys)


📐 Now you can proceed in two was:

(1) Follow the instructions of the Jupyter Notebook 👉 run_SVM.ipynb

(2) Make your processing pipeline by using the Python functions: calibrate.py, train.py and test.py. 
    (See in the instructions in files)
    
Have fun!
